# TestAutomation
End-To-End tests for mobile apps using Appium, Selenium and Java

WARNING: to run the tests you need to have appium and Android/iOS emulators installed and running 

I personally have .sh scripts to run them automaticly before tests (as in the picture below) but you can also run them manually
